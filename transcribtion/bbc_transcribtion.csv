1,5.28,11.44, the Internal Affairs Ministry says there are just over 14.6 million children in the country
2,11.44,16.8, under the age of 14. Japan's falling birth rate and high-life expectancy replacing huge

4,24.16,28.96," Stephanie Hegety, has been looking into the story. This is part of a global trend that we're"
5,28.96,34.480000000000004, seeing in all advanced economies and a lot of developing economies too. And it's dating back
6,34.480000000000004,40.0," to, after the war, is more women into the workforce. They decide to delay having children"
7,40.0,43.92, and they have less children as a result because the window for opportunity for having children is
8,43.92,49.760000000000005, shorter. But what we're seeing in Japan is that this is accelerated. I mean the Japanese government
9,49.760000000000005,56.16," didn't expect to be seeing these numbers until about 20, 20, 8. So, it's accelerating quite rapidly"
10,56.16,61.36," and that's for various reasons. What happens globally is when we have shocks, especially financial"
11,61.36,67.03999999999999, shocks. That leads people to take a step back and decide maybe it's not the time to have a child
12,67.03999999999999,71.84," now and we saw that in the 2008 crash, saw that in the late 90s and 80s and 80s and we saw it"
13,71.84,77.19999999999999," during the pandemic. So, these patterns are definitely accelerating and what tends to happen"
14,77.19999999999999,83.75999999999999," what happened after 2008 is people don't go backwards. You know, once a society decides to have"
15,83.76,89.68," less children they don't tend to then go back to having more later. I mean over the years,"
16,90.24000000000001,96.16000000000001, I sort of can't forget images I'd seen of children sitting at their mother's desk under
17,96.16000000000001,100.96000000000001, under the desk in the workplace in Japan because things like childcare are not necessarily
18,100.96000000000001,106.08000000000001, readily available. The whole structural and system of the workplace is it necessarily tailored
19,106.08000000000001,111.60000000000001, for a woman to be able to have those support networks? I think there's two dynamics that are playing
20,111.6,116.32," out not just in Japan but in their neighbors, China and South Korea where you've got these very"
21,116.32,120.72, advanced economies with a lot of women in work. Japan's got one of the highest ratios of women
22,120.72,125.6," in the workplace, higher than the US, for example, but it's also got really profound gender"
23,125.6,132.0, imbalances in domestic work so the amount of time on average that Japanese father spends
24,132.0,137.04," doing work at home is 41 minutes a day compared to the US, which is two and a half hours a day."
25,137.04,142.07999999999998," So this profound gender imbalance seems to be leading a lot of Japanese women to say, I don't want"
26,142.07999999999998,145.68," that life, I don't have to do everything at home and I don't want to have to work very hard."
27,145.68,150.32, And then you've also got this notorious work culture where people are expected to really put
28,150.32,153.35999999999999, in the hours and that's just not compatible with family life.
29,154.48,158.79999999999998, That's our course for a Stephanie Higuchi reporting there. Well that's it for me in the
30,158.8,169.84," team here on Impact, you can catch me on Twitter, I'm Ashbbc y'all to Higim, goodbye for now."
